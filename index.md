### 3. Environmental Gradients Across Costa Rica  
**Figure 3.** Spatial distribution of key environmental and anthropogenic variables:  
A) Mean annual temperature (BIO_01)  
B) Annual precipitation (BIO_12)  
C) Elevation (DEM)  
D) Human Footprint Index (HFP)  
All layers are projected to the same reference grid and show gradients from low (dark tones) to high (light tones).
